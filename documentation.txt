Iain GayProgFun FinalThe Virtual Caddy ProjectProblem Statement:This program will take in user input in order to determine what golf club should be used when a they are a certain distance from the hole. It must take in the distance of three shots with each club in the bag of the player, create an average, and then later use the average to determine the best club to use at a given distance from the hole. The program must also take in a username and assign the data input to the username. The user data must also be able to be modified by the user in the future. More features will be added later.Nouns: user input, golf club, distance from the hole, distance of three shots with club, average, usernameVerbs: take in, determine, create, use, assign, modifiedDefining DiagramInputs:userClubuserDistanceProcessing:read userNameprompt for userClubread userClubdisplay averageassign average to userClubread userDistancedisplay userClubOutputs:clubAverageuserClubPseudocode:note: This code will be implemented later. I would like to assign all the club datato a hash with a user name attached so that it can be accessed laterPushToArrayAlgorithm  initialize counter to 0  initialize userInfo to empty array  initialize userName to empty string  prompt fo username with "Please enter your user name."  loop username through userInfo (???)  IF array does not contain username DO    push username into end of userInfo  ENDIFEND:endnoteTest plans:  VARIABLES: userInput1, userInput2, userInput3, userClub  TEST 1:    INPUTS: 3, 4, 5, Driver    EXPECTED OUTPUT: The average distance of your driver is 4 yards.    ACTUAL OUTPUT: Same as expected  TEST 2:    INPUTS: 3, 4, 5, (Select)    EXPECTED OUTPUT: Please select a club!    ACTUAL OUTPUT: Same as expected.  TEST 3:    INPUTS: 221.3, 245, 233.3, driver    EXPECTED OUTPUT: The average distance of your driver is 233.2 yards.    ACTUAL OUTPUT: The text boxes I was using only use whole numbers.

I was constantly testing throughout  the build.VirtualCaddyMainAlgorithm  initialize systemClub to [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]  initialize userAverage to 0  initialize userClub  initialize userOutput to 0  WHILE ()    get userClub from DOM element    get userInput1, 2 and 3 from DOM element    convert userInput1, 2, and 3  to number    userAverage = (userInput1 + userInput2 + userInput3) / 3    IF (userClub === "sand wedge") DO      push userAverage to 0 in array    ELSIF (userClub === "pitching wedge") DO      push userAverage to 1 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "9 iron") DO      push userAverage to 3 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "8 iron") DO      push userAverage to 4 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "7 iron") DO      push userAverage to 5 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "6 iron") DO      push userAverage to 6 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "5 iron" ) DO      push userAverage to 7 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "4 iron") DO      push userAverage to 8 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "3 iron") DO      push userAverage to 9 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "7 wood") DO      push userAverage to 10 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "5 wood") DO      push userAverage to 11 in array    ELSEIF (userClub === "3 wood") DO      push userAverage to 12 in array    ELSIF (userClub === "Driver") DO      push userAverage to 13 in array    ENDIF    display userAverage and userClub formatted as "The average distance of your "    + userClub + " is " + userAverage + " yards."note: I built the program using this pseudocode as a starting point.
